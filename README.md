# Todoers

This is a website created as a project to practice some web design principles. Also, I've been trying out new frameworks and tools to help me be more productive while maintaining a clean looking design.

## Demo

The page supports both light and dark mode. This website is still under development, so please keep up an eye on the different commits to catch up with the progress.

#### LIGHT

#### DARK

## Deployment

To deploy this project just clone. As of now I'm still working on this so you can run a development version by using

```bash
  npm run dev
```

This will open a new page that will refresh based on the changes to the dist and src files. You might want to build the project if the changes are not being shown with:

```bash
  npm run build
```
